## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

PrepTalk loads its settings from:
```
~/.prepTalk.toml
```

Example configuration:
```toml
heading = "Welcome to your Linux Laptop"
body = "We want you to have a few applications and settings configured..."
logo = "/path/to/logo.png"
file = "/path/to/prep.log"
task_total = 10
```

---

## üìÑ Log File Format

PrepTalk reads the **last line** of the log file and expects it in TOML key-value style.  
Example:
```toml
task_msg = "Installing package xyz"
task_number = 4
task_complete = "false"
```
We can also read one-line pseudo TOML
```toml
task_msg = "Configuring default Browser" task_number = 65
```
